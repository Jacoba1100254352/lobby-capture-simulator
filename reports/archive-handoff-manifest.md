# Archive Handoff Manifest

This report records the release asset set and stable source-metadata checksums that should be used when minting a DOI archive. It is a handoff aid, not proof that a DOI has been minted.

PDF and ZIP byte streams can differ across TeX and archive implementations. The release-machine checksums for those binary assets are written to `dist/release-asset-checksums.{csv,json,md}` and should be attached to the GitHub release or DOI deposit record.

## Archive Use

When minting a DOI archive, upload the primary release assets listed above or verify that the repository-to-archive integration preserved the selected assets. Attach or retain `dist/release-asset-checksums.{csv,json,md}` from the release machine for byte-level PDF and ZIP verification. Keep the source archive for the tagged release with `CITATION.cff`, `.zenodo.json`, `reports/submission-readiness.md`, `reports/final-human-readthrough.md`, and `reports/final-human-readthrough-audit.md` so the DOI record can be tied back to the exact claim boundary and manual signoff state.

After this manifest is generated, `reports/doi-deposit-readiness.md` records whether the release metadata, asset checksums, DOI record, and human read-through state are ready for final journal submission.
